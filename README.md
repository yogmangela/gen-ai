# 📌 Real-Life Use Cases of Algorithms

This document provides real-world applications of different algorithms categorized by type. 

## 📌 1️⃣ Searching Algorithms

### 🔹 Linear Search (Sequential Search)
📌 **Use Case:** Searching for a contact on your phone.
🔹 When looking for a name in an unsorted list, you check each entry one by one.

### 🔹 Binary Search (Divide and Conquer)
📌 **Use Case:** Looking up a word in a dictionary.
🔹 You open the dictionary in the middle and decide if the word is in the first or second half, reducing search time.

### 🔹 Jump Search
📌 **Use Case:** Searching in a large database.
🔹 Used in search engines for efficient keyword lookups in indexed documents.

### 🔹 Interpolation Search
📌 **Use Case:** Searching for a price in a sorted price list.
🔹 If a store has product prices sorted, it estimates where the price might be instead of searching sequentially.
